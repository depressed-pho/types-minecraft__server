# TypeScript definitions for `@minecraft/server`

This should really be hosted by
[DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) but
until the API is stabilized it's rather hard to do. There is already an NPM
package
[@minecraft/server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@minecraft/server) but it
seems to be totally incomplete, which is why I maintain a separate
repository.

## Usage

```shell
% npm i -D github:depressed-pho/types-minecraft__server
```

```typescript
import { World } from "@minecraft/server"
```
